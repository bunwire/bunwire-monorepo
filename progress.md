## Implemented

- Monorepo and mechanically enforced package boundaries.
- Generic managed-class metadata and decorator-definition APIs.
- Runtime DI container with explicit bindings, tokens, indexed constructor metadata, and singleton/transient scopes.
- Built-in Service, Controller, and Provider kinds and decorators implemented through the generic managed-class extension APIs.
- Instantiated Application/kernel lifecycle with Provider registries, explicit registration precedence, manual context, and isolated invocation scopes.
- Generic managed-method kinds, canonical class- and method-kind identity, strictly validated prebuilt parameter plans, custom resolver IDs, middleware, caller validation, and platform-independent invocation.
- Class-based primary-host adapters with guarded compiler/runtime contributions, prepared/manual host context, adapter-owned Providers, validation hooks, decorator-bound runtime registry consumers, native callbacks, and fake-adapter end-to-end proof.
- Declarative bounded Bunwire config, cycle-safe source discovery, default-export-anchored bootstrap analysis, ESM-authoritative adapter resolution, canonical extension aggregation, typed diagnostics, and the reserved `virtual:bunwire/*` namespace.
- Symbol-resolved managed-class discovery and indexed constructor DI plans with explicit token/class injection and strict plain-class/interface boundaries.
- Complete managed-method parameter plans with independent method/caller indexes, injector precedence, optional/rest semantics, caller bounds, and compile-time placement/source validation.
- Canonical compiler-symbol authorization, strict runtime-token validation, inherited-constructor safeguards, managed dependency-cycle detection, and concrete instance-method enforcement.
- Deterministic generated registries and `virtual:bunwire/registry`, with exported runtime imports, class scopes, constructor plans, generated Providers, managed methods, resolver IDs, adapter metadata, middleware arrays, stable hashes, and direct Core runtime execution.
- All test definitions, clean-install automation, and fixtures centralized beneath `tests/`.

## Current Work

- None. Milestone 10 is complete and verified.

## Next

- Milestone 11 — Electrobun Adapter (not started).

## Blockers
